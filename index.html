    <h1>SORTING CHECKPOINT</h1>
    <p>implementation of Insertion Sort using JavaScript:

        Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. Each time we take a new card we put it in the right place in our hand.
        
        i. Each time work only with the first i-1 element from of the array
        ii. Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence in the array from 0 to i-1</p>
