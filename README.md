implementation of Insertion Sort using JavaScript:

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. Each time we take a new card we put it in the right place in our hand.

i. Each time work only with the first i-1 element from of the array
ii. Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence in the array from 0 to i-1
